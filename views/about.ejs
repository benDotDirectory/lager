<h2>About lager</h2>
<p>
    lager allows logging over http. Say you are writing an app and don't like logging to the console and don't want to implement your own logger. Just make a <code>POST</code> 
    request to <code>http://local-lager-server/lager/log/write-log?app="my-app"&text="Hello world"</code>
    
    ... and lager will take care of it for you. It will write to a text file log, and make that log viewable on
    <code>http://local-lager-server/lager/log/view-log?app="my-app"</code>.
